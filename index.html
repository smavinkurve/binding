	 <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
	 <h1 class="heading-introduction"> Slow Descent into (Branding) Madness</h1>
	 <p> Design is extremely complex today with countless viewports and touchpoints. What is branding in today’s age? Everything that is designed in a web of complexity. How does one make sense of this complexity to add value to it?
		Michael Rock reminds of both the overabundance of imagery and branding, and that design at its core is malleable. 
		The world is complicated, everything we perceive is nested within further layers of complexity. As designers, we shouldn’t forget that the world around us, with all its brands, devices, design, and norms, were once an idea. Everything is malleable despite its apparent solidity.
